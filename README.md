# Process
This project was a realization of how many libraries and API's are out there that can be used together 
to develop amazing applications. We used a library called Handtrack.js that allows us to read realtime
hand detections from your webcam. This allowed us to call certain functions from the Spotify's WebPlayer
using different hand gestures. 

We created a simple Spotify playlist viewer using Angular, CSS, and HTML. Users will be able to chose any 
of their playlists and play any song from it. The web app will ask to use your webcam to enable the Handtrack
feature. After enabling, the user will be able to give handgestures that activate webplayer functions such as
play/pause, shuffle, next song, and volume.
